					Can you believe I promise I'd release this back in september, and it took me until<br>
					now to finally fulfill this promise?...<br>
					But hey, you know what they say about spilled milk, right?<br>
					Either way, feast your eyes, because I've finished the blog section!<br>
					...So what now?<br>
					That's it, you don't get anything else. I promised you a blog section.<br>
					You don't get anything else. Fuck you.</p>

					<p style="margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:6px;font-family:NokiaFC;font-size:65%;text-align:left;">
					Alright, jokes aside, with this burden out of my back, I can finally start bringing you all<br>
					the cool stuff I've been promising you, like stupid ramblings, me complaining about<br>
					how the internet and every cool thing about it has died, and all that stupid shit you<br>
					probably don't care nor signed for! Doesn't this sound like a dream?<br>
					<br>
					But I guess you all also deserve answers; the biggest one being;<br>
					<span style="font-size:300%;" class="textshake">WHAT TOOK YOU SO FUCKING<br>
						LONG THAT IT TOOK YOU ALMOST<br>
						FIVE MONTHS TO UPDATE YOUR<br>
						GODDAMN WEBSITE WHEN YOU<br>
						PROMISED AT LEAST FIVE TIMES<br>
						THAT THE UPDATE WOULD BE<br>
						RELEASED IN AT LEAST A WEEK? >:(<br></span><br>
					And to that I say <span style="font-size:300%;">CALM YOUR TITS DOWN!</span><br>
					There is no way you were that excited for anothe RootPain.com update, and if you were<br>
					you probably need a job, or two... or maybe I should stop promising things and never going<br>
					through them... but it's most likely you that need more jobs, or just a job in general!<br>
					<br>
					Anyways, the best way to put why this update took so long to come out;<br>
					<br>
					<span style="font-size:300%;">Depression. :(</span><br>
					<br>
					Also, I have a job too, I think, but depression was the main cause, like always.<br>
					A bunch of things happened at the same time I promised that the new update would be out<br>
					Most of them involving other people around me being complete fucking morons and I having<br>
					to deal with their shit because they're too clueless to notice the problem themselves<br>
					Couple that with the time and energy restraints that my current job imposes on me<br>
					and you get a very depressed little me, not wanting to do jackshit, despite how much<br>
					I really want to.<br>
					But I think enough time has passed, and I can't be down forever, afterall, the internet<br>
					is dying, and it's in dire need of a hero, a hero that will bring fun back to it<br>
					A hero that will inspire others to pursue making their own websites<br>
					Someone to save the internet and bring back the fun of exploring a diverse website<br>
					that express the creator's personality within every page!<br>
					<br>
					I don't think that's going to be me, but hey, it could be, if I try hard enough<br>
					Probably not.<br>
					<br>
					But hey, at least I'm relatively still trying, kinda!<br>
					Things aren't really stylized as of now, I'm keeping things a tad simple as of now<br>
					but soon, we'll have chapter selection, better categorization, and etc...<br>
					Once I actually figure out how to tackle these, but no more promises since last time<br>
					I promised something it went like absolute shit, so you'll just have to hope for the best.<br>
					<br>
					Either way, my bitches are too different, my game is too bad, and I need to stop<br>
					And I also need to launch this update already in preparation for better articles<br>
					Go check GameSlime.com when it's back up, or whatever<br>
					I will see you soon, friend(interrogation point?).</p>
