					I've seen a lot of people, specially friends, claim that they like fighting games<br>
					but they never seem to be able to get into, or properly learn how to "play" them<br>
					despite the interest being there. And I perfectly understand why<br>
					Other genres of games are very straight forward, games like shootin games are<br>
					relatively easy to pick and understand, with most changing being classes<br>
					and weapons in which you can learn in five or ten minutes, and other genres like<br>
					platformers are so simple, anyone could pick and play them instantly</p>

					<p style="margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:6px;font-family:NokiaFC;font-size:65%;text-align:left;">
					Fighting games, however, are their own can of worms that seemingly change completely with<br>
					each new entry, series, and even updates in general, which makes learning fighting games<br>
					a daunting task for most new players, because they see how different every game is, not only<br>
					within it's own series, but to others aswell, that they don't know where or how to start<br>
					because a lot of them think they'll have to relearn an entirely new genre once a new entry<br>
					comes out due to how much these games seem to add, change or remove mechanics with each<br>
					new entry, which ends up discouraging a lot of people from even trying to begin with<br>
					<br>
					SF3:Third Strike was completely different from SF3:Second Impact, Guilty Gear Strive<br>
					is completely different from GG:Xrd and GGXXACPR (for the worse), and so on<br>
					<br>
					But what a lot of new players don't know, is that despite all these games being completely<br>
					different from each other, most of them share the same foundation, so just like the other<br>
					genres, despite each game having it's own characters and mechanics to learn, once you learn<br>
					certain rules and foundations, they'll carry on to other titles aswell, and you'll be able<br>
					to learn and adapt yourself to new games easier and faster<br>
					<br>
					And since some of my friends keep telling me "Wow, June, you're quite good at fighting games<br>
					and handsome too! you should probably make a guide on how to play fighting games so I can be<br>
					as smart and handsome like you one day!"<br><br>
					I figured out it could be a nice idea, because anyone can play fighting games, but properly<br>
					learning them while still enjoying yourself? Not so much.<br>
					<br>
					Believe me or not, but I used to hate fighting games when I was younger, but after learning<br>
					a few things and taking a bit of a time with them, I learned how to love them, and if I can<br>
					learn how to love, you can too! probably! it's not guaranteed!<br>
					<br>
					So now, I'll teach and show you some of the things that helped me not only learn how to enjoy<br>
					this genre, but helped me improve when it comes to playing them aswell<br>
					<br>
					Buckle up, fucker, because this is...</p>
