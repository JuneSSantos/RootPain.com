					Well, it seems like we're finally here, at the end of 2023.<br>
					Man, this year was a rollercoaster and a half, with a lot of ups, with some<br>
					incredibly schizophrenic ups and downs, enough to give you whiplash<br>
					And since everyone is doing one of these, and I like writting a lot<br>
					It's only natural I'd also do my own 2023 recap<br>
					Although I did had a lot of trouble trying to figure out where to start<br>
					due to how chaotic this year as a whole was</p>

					<p style="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:6px;font-family:NokiaFC;font-size:65%;text-align:left;">
					But I gotta do it either way, so we might aswell start with my initial expectations for 2023<br>
					My initial expectations and plans for 2023 was making sure this year was better than 2022 was<br>
					I wanted to break new heights, do new things, meet new people and in general, just do better<br>
					than I did in 2022, which all things considered, wouldn't be so hard considering 2022 sucked<br>
					major dick. so I already had some sort of objective or goal to look forward to<br>
					<br>
					And in a way, I broke those new heights at the very beginning of 2023, by getting a job<br>
					I know, groundbreaking stuff.<br>
					Sarcasm aside, that was already a huge improvement over last year, in which I had to<br>
					save a lot of money to be able to afford below-average living conditions and just enough food<br>
					to keep me alive. Now with this job, I could afford more things, could actually afford an actual<br>
					meal, and in general, I reached complete independence, and in a lot of ways, I learned how to<br>
					handle real adult responsibilities, which helped me grow as a person significantly, specially when<br>
					in comparision to the previous years<br>
					<br>
					Back then, specially around 2021 and a bit of 2022, I was an incredibly bitter, awful guy<br>
					that would just bitch and complain about everyone and everything, mostly because I was<br>
					sad and unsatisfied with myself, which made me lash onto other people that were clearly<br>
					just minding their own business, and did not deserve my shit at all<br>
					I was constantly trying to shit and strike down on others, because it was easier to convince<br>
					myself everyone else was doing the wrong thing, instead of me just seeing things for the way<br>
					they were, the way being the fact I was just a sad loser unsatisfied with myself and my works<br>
					to the point it was easier to try and strike others down instead of improving myself<br>
					<br>
					But then I started interacting with others more, I learned how to better respect others<br>
					I learned how to actually deliver and handle criticism, instead of trying thinly disguise<br>
					my bitterness as criticism<br>
					<br>
					I made new friendships, rekindled old ones, and even befriended a ton of people I always wanted<br>
					but never thought I could befriend before, and in general, I just grew a ton, not only as<br>
					creative, but as a functioning human being<br>
					<br>
					In a lot of ways, 2023 was a year of growth, not only because I've improved a lot with my works<br>
					like how the website you're currently seeing being made this year, after months of studying<br>
					and work, and how I grew as a person and how I dealt with life and others<br>
					<br>
					But this growth didn't come without a cost, I had to go through a lot in order to get where<br>
					I am right now.<br>
					<br>
					Just as this year was incredibly productive and helped me improve a lot<br>
					It was just as stressful and painful to get through<br>
					<br>
					One of the main problems I had with this year, was adapting to having a job, because despite<br>
					the fact I enjoyed having some sort of responsibility, because now I had an actual reason to<br>
					value my time, since I didn't have free time 24/7 any longer, my job also left me incredibly<br>
					tired and at times demotivated, mostly due to some of my coworkers giving me some<br>
					hard times over things that really didn't need to be hard to begin with<br>
					And even when I had free time, I was feeling so weak and tired, I couldn't even bring myself<br>
					to do the things I like any longer and this really affected my output, specially with my website<br>
					<br>
					Not only that, but living by myself, despite being infinitely better than living with my family<br>
					around me, started to get really depressing, because I kept remembering my friends from<br>
					my old hometown and how much we used to hang, and I didn't know anyone in the place<br>
					I was living only talking to anyone at work, or discord, which wasn't optimal at all<br>
					despite how much I enjoyed my time with my friends<br>
					<br>
					But I could manage that, in fact, I was even expecting things to get a little depressing<br>
					after a while, afterall, you can only be alone for so long before losing your head<br>
					<br>
					However, when trying to open myself up to new friends and meeting new people, I ended up<br>
					meeting some guys on another server I was in, and despite the fact I've heard awful things<br>
					about them from my friends and other acquaintances before, I still decided to give to give them<br>
					a chance, because maybe they were just exaggerated slapfights, and maybe they could end up being<br>
					decent people, or even good friends in the long run<br>
					<br>
					Not listening to my gut instincts and being too soft was the biggest mistake I made this year.<br>
					<br>
					These people were insuffering, specially with how pretentious they were, with most things<br>
					coming out of their mouths being a passive-aggressive comment, or something of the kind<br>
					and in general, their behavior was just how I behaved a while ago (which is kinda sad when<br>
					taking into consideration most of them are older than me) with them going on crusades<br>
					with their little group to try and strike down on anything and anyone they don't like and<br>
					disguising their pretentious whining as "criticism", which in a lot of ways, helped me<br>
					see a problem I had within myself, and the little interactions I've had with them served<br>
					as an example of what I didn't want to become myself<br>
					<br>
					And letting one of those people around me almost lead him pulling my friend over his group<br>
					and their drama, and that would lead me into dealing with this situation myself, specially<br>
					because I felt guilty over letting him near my friend, despite the fact there were tons of<br>
					red flags from the very beginning.<br>
					<br>
					And this was a stressful situation that would go on for months, a situation that stressed<br>
					me for months, because I wouldn't allow others, specially someone I should've kicked out of<br>
					my side from the very beginning.<br>
					<br>
					And I would eventually resolve the situation completely, but the ongoing stress at points felt<br>
					like too much for me, to the point at times I almost considered just letting my friendship<br>
					just be done and over with<br>
					<br>
					But I'm not one to just give up on others that easily<br>
					and despite the increasingly grim odds stacked against me, I managed to solve everything<br>
					both me and my friend would admit our faults over that situation, and we would rekindle<br>
					things once and for all, and now, I'm happy again.<br>
					<br>
					And despite everything, that whole situation helped me a ton aswell<br>
					because it made me realize that I was being too soft and forgiving people that really did not<br>
					earn nor deserve that forgiveness, and it made me realize the type of people I wanted to keep<br>
					around me, it helped me to remind to keep myself strong when it comes to what I believe and the<br>
					types of values and friendships I want to protect and fight for, because if I just gave up on my<br>
					friend, I would've lost an amazing relation over people that were never worth the time<br>
					to begin with, and none of us would be happy about it, but I think we both came out of that<br>
					situation learning a thing or two<br>
					<br>
					And in general, this situation would lead other people reaching me out to help me, and I saw how<br>
					many people actually liked and cared about me. They'd ask me almost on a daily basis on<br>
					how I was doing, what I should do, and I'd even start talking with some people I never expected<br>
					to start anything with over this whole ordeal<br>
					<br>
					It was stressful, and in a lot of ways, it's my fault that this whole thing happened to begin with<br>
					If I just went with my gut instincts instead of blatantly ignoring common sense and just pretending<br>
					the issue wasn't there in front of me, none of this would've happened to begin with.<br>
					<br>
					But everything's well when it ends well<br>
					In fact, things couldn't be better<br>
					<br>
					I have incredibly friends, I've rekindled old friendships, made new ones, made the ones that I had<br>
					stronger than they were before, I've matured a lot, both as an artist and as a person, I've even<br>
					moved out of my old, falling apart crack house to this new house with my old childhood friends<br>
					and now, I'm surrounded by people that legitimately love and care for me, with things seemingly<br>
					only getting better as the days go by, with me about to get my english certificate to work as a<br>
					translator on a hotel, and moving to a bigger apartment next year, so despite all of the work<br>
					I had to put through this year, it was a legitimately good year<br>
					<br>
					And a good part of that was because of you, probably.<br>
					<br>
					And before we close the year, and this post, I want to make some shoutouts<br>
					<br>
					<a href="https://joe-mega.newgrounds.com/" target="_blank"><span>Joe-Mega</span></a>: You were always such a nice friend, and in a lot of ways, I see you as a big brother<br>
					not only literally, because you're big and fat (and has a big heart), but because you're the type<br>
					of guy I look up to be when I grow older, a good friend, a great brother, an honest worker<br>
					legitimately one of the funniest guys I met, and in general, just an incredible guy all around<br>
					I can be incredibly hard to deal at times, but you've never gave up on me, and you kept calling<br>
					me out when I no one would, and inspiring me when I needed the most, in fact, my first website<br>
					and specially this one evolved mostly because of you, and I'm incredibly grateful for you<br>
					and forever will be, and I hope one day I can be as great of a guy as you are (I hope I don't<br>
					get as fat tho, I only want a fat heart. Sorry, Joe!) I hope your christmas is a merry one<br>
					<br>
					<a href="https://staggernight.newgrounds.com/" target="_blank"><span style="color:orange;">StaggerNight (Sage)</span></a>: You are such a great friend, you've reached me out countless times<br>
					helped me countless times when I had no one to run to, the times we talked for hours on end<br>
					and you helped me see things a little more clearly, and learn more, not only about myself<br>
					but about life in general, I think if it weren't for you, I would have not gotten as far<br>
					as I did. And hey, spending time with you, like when we play Dragon Ball FighterZ or when we're<br>
					just shooting the shit, like talking about Gloria or the Annoying Orange singing spanish undertale<br>
					will never not put a smile on my face whenever I remember those times.<br>
					I hope one day I kaioken get you a beer, and don't you worry, I kaioken get it done, probably.<br>
					(don't count on it so soon!) My scarab will be at your door in at least two days.<br>
					Happy holidays!<br>
					<br>
					<a href="https://orkork.newgrounds.com/" target="_blank"><span style="color:orange;">OrkOrk</span></a>: Man, you're legitimately one of the coolest guys I've ever met, not only you're one of<br>
					the funniest guys I've ever met, but you're such a genuine, loving guy, you've been an immense<br>
					help to me this year, and being able to spend my time around you, either just chatting, shooting<br>
					the shit, or even playing Street Fighter always made me so happy.<br>
					I hope you know how much of a sweet guy you are, I love you, man, I hope your christmas will be<br>
					a great one. My scarab will be at your door in two hours.<br>
					<br>
					<a href="https://tiltro.newgrounds.com/" target="_blank"><span>Tiltro</a></span>: You're such a nice fellow, Tiltro, the sweetest one around<br>
					Everyone keeps talking about how you're a good egg, and how being around you always brings<br>
					their mood up, and they're right, it's nigh-impossible to be sad with someone like you around<br>
					You've clearly made a ton of proggress this year, both with your studies, your art and animations<br>
					I love seeing anything to do with your, from your turtles, to your animations, or even just being<br>
					around you, seeing you being silly on your camera or the voice chat, it's always so nice to hang<br>
					with you, I hope you never stop being the great guy you are, and that you'll always keep smiling<br>
					and spreading (holiday) cheer like you always do. I hope your christmas will be the happiest one<br>
					I'll send my christmas scarab to you now.<br>
					<br>
					Asura: You are still one of my greatest friends, despite the fact you're rarely around nowadays<br>
					I still remember the times we played together, and you were always there when I needed you<br>

					<a href="https://blueespresso.newgrounds.com/" target="_blank"><span>Chyra</span></a>: You were incredibly nice for me through this whole year, I still have all your fanart and<br>

					to be an animator, godspeed to you.<br>
					<br>
					<a href="https://oddlem.newgrounds.com/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#9F2B68;">Oddlem</span></a>: You're such an incredible person, ever since I met you, you've been nothing but nice<br>
					and incredibly supportive of me, at times it felt like you just knew when to come to talk to me<br>
					I had so much fun talking to you, not only about serious things, but just talking in general<br>
					It always makes me so happy whenever you show up, your art is fantastic, I loved just seeing<br>
					you going crazy over cats and birds, you discussing your plans for the future, like your videos<br>
					and your programming, and talking to you always makes me feel at ease<br>
					I know you think you might go too crazy at times, but I'll say this now; never change.<br>
					People like you a lot because you are you, and same goes for me, keep going crazy<br>
					And keep going hard, I hope next year will bring you a better job, and everything you're<br>
					looking for. My scarab is at your door.<br>
