		<h2>who is rootpain?</h2>
		<p style="margin-top:-34px;">Me, that's me, the guy who made this website.<br>
		I'm RootPain, also known as June S. Sai and/or Big Whiskey<br>
		<br>
		I'm just some guy who lives in Brazil with a love for all things good<br>
		Like good web design, good friends, good music, good games and so on<br>
		<br>
		I have interest on lots of things, but the main ones which I can point are<br>
		Sonic, Doom & Quake (and Boomer Shooters in general), Worms, Nine Inch Nails<br>
		Old Websites around 2006-2013, Web Design and Web Development and Sunflowers<br>
		<br>
		And for the things I hate, I could list them for hour, but I'll just mention<br>
		some of the things I hate the most, with those being modern web design<br>
		social medias and most of the people in there (mostly Twitter)<br>
		modern internet culture, relationships, olives, and unfunny people.<br>
		<br>
		I have a lot to talk about, but I guess you'll have to either talk directly<br>
		to me, or stick around the website and find out what!</p>

		<div style="display:flex;flex-direction:column;width:682px;margin-top:-25px;">
			<h2 style="text-align:right;">what is rootpain.com?</h2>
			<p style="margin-top:-34px;text-align:right;">RootPain.com is all things considered my passion project that I've been building up<br>
			for years now, but only now it's fully realised<br>
			<br>
			RootPain.com, formerly known as JuneSSai.net is a tribute to the era of the internet<br>
			that I grew up in, mostly inspired on The Mystical Forest Zone and countless other<br>
			sources like Power Sonic, Something Awful, Newgrounds and etc.<br>
			I made with the intent of recreating and succeeding on what those sites were trying<br>
			to do back in the day, to make something special in which people would come back<br>
			from time to time to see what's new, or simply because they just enjoyed the site<br>
			that much.<br>
			<br>
			RootPain.com was also made out of spite, to prove that Modern Web Design is absolute<br>
			dogshit, and not because of a lack of technology, development tools or resources<br>
			but because everyone is opting to be lazy and making their sites dull and boring<br>
			while simultaneously making them hard to navigate for no reason<br>
			<br>
			One of the main objectives with RootPain.com was to make a site that's not only<br>
			interesting to look at at every page, but you'd be able to find everything you<br>
			want or need easily without having to compromise visual detail or style<br>
			And the second objective making something memorable, something that someone maybe<br>
			in a few years in the future will remember fondly, and they'll say to themselves<br>
			"I want to see that again, and maybe one day, make something like that too"<br>
			just like how those sites did for me back in the day, they inspired me, and I hope<br>
			that I can inspire someone else out there aswell.</p>

		<h2 style="text-align:left;">special thanks</h2>
		<p style="margin-top:-34px;">My boys from Boot Rot were always helpful towards me, and they really supported me<br>
		and my website through the entirety of it's run, so they're forever homies<br>
		<br>
		Octo (AKA QMaury) introduced me to Boot Rot, Quake and tons of other things that<br>
		I like, and his website inspired me to make my own, so thanks for that<br>
		<br>
		Daemon+ helped me with a lot of coding and software related issues<br>
		<br>
		Storkinspork was also with me through the entirety of the website's run<br>
		<br>
		The Stackoverflow Community helped me with a lot of the problems I had when<br>
		I first started learning how to code<br>
		<br>
		BeatumPopcorn provided a lot of the initial art used when the website first came<br>
		out, and despite all things, I still have the guy in my heart.<br>
		<br>
		Joe-Mega was always a good friend for supporting me and my endeavors, and he<br>
		more than anyone believed in me and my website, and I doubt I'd have the same<br>
		drive to continue working on this if not for him<br>
		<br>
		And you, for sticking around, or simply for giving the website a chance<br>
		<br>
		I'll see you around, and I hope you'll be there when the time comes.</p>
